# 📊 Pandas Practice Notebook: Sorting, Ranking, Axis Indexes, and Duplicate Labels

This repository provides an in-depth and hands-on practice notebook focusing on key pandas concepts such as sorting, ranking, dealing with duplicate indexes, and using `loc` and `iloc` for selection and assignment. It uses two datasets — `material.csv` and `Data.csv` — to demonstrate and solve over 40 practical problems relevant to real-world material science and engineering data.

---

## 📁 Datasets Included

- `material.csv`: Contains material properties such as `Su`, `Sy`, `E`, `Ro`, and `mu`, as well as treatment and usage flags. It serves as the core dataset for sorting, ranking, and label manipulation tasks.
- `Data.csv`: Supplementary material dataset used primarily for axis index manipulation, duplicate index detection, and advanced indexing exercises.

## 📘 What's Inside the Notebook

### 🔢 Core Topics Covered

1. **Sorting**
   - Sort by columns in ascending/descending order
   - Handle `NaN` placement during sorting
   - Sort by index or multiple criteria

2. **Ranking**
   - Rank with various methods (`average`, `min`, `dense`, `first`)
   - Combined ranks from multiple fields
   - Material strength ranking use case

3. **Duplicate Indexes**
   - Simulate and detect duplicated index values
   - Resetting and reindexing operations
   - Handling non-unique labels

4. **Using `loc` and `iloc`**
   - Extracting subsets based on conditionals
   - Updating rows and columns
   - Boolean indexing, label-based and position-based selection

5. **Advanced Practice**
   - Linearly updating values using `iloc`
   - Reversing DataFrame order
   - Working with `duplicated()` using `keep=False`
   - Removing duplicates based on custom combinations

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Master the foundational and intermediate use of `pandas` for sorting, ranking, and indexing.
- Understand how to manage and clean datasets with duplicated labels or indices.
- Practice real-world-like problems using datasets relevant to engineering materials.
- Gain fluency in both label-based (`loc`) and position-based (`iloc`) data manipulation techniques.

---

## 🚀 Applications in Engineering and AI

- Material selection pipelines in mechanical engineering.
- Data cleaning for AI preprocessing (handling duplicates, ordering, indexing).
- Feature ranking and outlier identification in supervised learning models.
- Stress testing of datasets for robustness in manufacturing or structural design simulations.
